\value{
A matrix of pseudo-features where rows are cells and columns are features.
}
\description{
Creates a matrix of latent features (analogous to PCs) for single cells.
The variance of these features can be attributed to different metadata
variables like cell type, disease, batch, etc., according to specified ratios.
